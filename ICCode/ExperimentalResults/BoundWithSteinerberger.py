# Much of this code is due to J. Arias de Reyna and J. van de Lune.
# It was modified for the purposes of the paper "On Algorithms to Calculate
# Integer Complexity" by Cordwell, Epstein, Hemmady, Miller, Palsson, Sharma, Steinerberger, and
# Yen Nhi Truong Vu. Our work closely follows "Algorithms for Determining Integer Complexity" 
# by Arias de Reyna and van de Lune.

# We introduce a precomputation and check how often the precomputation yields an improved
# summand bound. (See Section 4 in "On Algorithms to Calculate Integer Complexity".)
# Here we use Steinerberger's Markov chain algorithm in the precomputation.

# Run this code with Python 2.7.
